      <h2>19 September 2023 – Badrutt`s Palace Hotel has been named No. 43 in the new global ranking 
of The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2023. The list has been announced at a captivating awards 
ceremony in London, and includes industry-defining hotels from 35 different locations across six

<p>"It makes us proud that Badrutt`s Palace Hotel is one of “The World's 50 Best Hotels”. Every award 
you receive as a hotel is a special distinction but to be included in the list of “The World's 50 Best 
Hotels” is a very special honor. It shows us that our service, our philosophy, the extra miles we go for 
our guests are bearing fruit," says Richard Leuenberger, Managing Director of Badrutt`s Palace Hotel.</p>

      <h2>Every aspect of a hotel guest’s stay is touched by housekeeping. If it does not meet the highest quality, it can change the guest’s entire perception – a single hair in the sink or a mark on the pillow can compromise an otherwise perfect stay.

It is why Veronika Schmidt has one of the most important jobs at Badrutt’s Palace, leading a team of nearly 50 people who are responsible for meeting the exacting standards of cleanliness and service that have been upheld at the Palace for more than 125 years.

As Executive Housekeeper, Schmidt and her team of supervisors, room attendants and porters devote themselves every day to creating a comfortable and welcoming environment for their guests. “Our role is not simply to clean rooms,” adds Schmidt, who is originally from Landshut in Bavaria and joined the hotel in 2019. “We are encouraged to get to know and care for our guests’ needs and preferences.” She describes her job as “extraordinary”, adding: “Working in an environment that is so rich in history, tradition and luxury is a very unique and special responsibility.”
